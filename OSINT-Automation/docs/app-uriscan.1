.SH NAME
.PP
Uriscan
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
Our APIs allow you to submit URLs for scanning and retrieve the results
once the scan has finished.
Furthermore, you can use an API for searching existing scans by
attributes such as domains, IPs, Autonomous System (AS) numbers, hashes,
etc.
To use the APIs, you should create a user account, attach an API key and
supply it when calling the API.
Unauthenticated users only received minor quotas for API calls.
.PP
To get started with our API, check out one of the existing tools and
integrations for urlscan.io
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]Search API\f[R]
.PP
You can use the same ElasticSearch syntax to search for scans as on the
Search page.
Each result has high-level metadata about the scan result and a link to
the API for the full scan result.
For a comprehensive list of available searchable fields, consult the
urlscan.io Search API Reference.
.PP
curl Tines curl
\[lq]https://urlscan.io/api/v1/search/?q=domain:urlscan.io\[rq]
Available query parameters for the search endpoint: q The query term
(ElasticSearch Query String Query).
Default: \[lq]*\[rq] size Number of results returned.
Default: 100, Max: 10000 (depending on your subscription) search_after
For retrieving the next batch of results, value of the sort attribute of
the last (oldest) result you received (comma-separated).
The search API returns an array of results where each entry includes
these items:
.PP
_id The UUID of the scan sort The sort key, to be used with search_after
page Information about the page after it finished loading task
Parameters for the scan stats High-level stats about the page brand Pro
Only Detected phishing against specific brands For comprehensive list of
available searchable fields, consult the urlscan.io Search API
Reference.
The API search will only indicate an exact count of results up to 10,000
results in the total property.
After that the has_more flag will be true.
Use the sort value of the last (i.e.\ oldest) scan result in the current
list of results as a parameter for the next Search API call.
Supply this value in the search_after query parameter for getting the
next (older) batch of results.
.PP
API search will find Public scans performed by anyone as well as
Unlisted and Private scans performed by you or your teams.
.PP
\f[B]Error Codes\f[R]
.PP
The API returns different error codes using the HTTP status and will
also include some high-level information in the JSON response, including
the status code, a message and sometimes a more elaborate description.
.PP
For scan submissions, there are various reasons why a scan request
won\[cq]t be accepted and will return an error code.
This includes, among others:
.PP
Blacklisted domains and URLs, requested to be blacklisted by their
respective owners.
Spammy submissions of URLs known to be used only for spamming this
service.
Invalid hostnames or invalid protocol schemes (FTP etc).
Missing URL property \&...
yes, it does happen.
Contains HTTP basic auth information \&...
yes, that happens as well.
Non-resolvable hostnames (A, AAAA, CNAME) which we will not even try to
scan.
An error will typically be indicated by the HTTP 400 status code.
It might look like this:
.PP
{ \[lq]message\[rq]: \[lq]DNS Error - Could not resolve domain\[rq],
\[lq]description\[rq]: \[lq]The domain .google.com could not be resolved
to a valid IPv4/IPv6 address.
We won\[cq]t try to load it in the browser.\[rq], \[lq]status\[rq]: 400
} If you think an error is incorrect, let us know via mail!
